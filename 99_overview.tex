Our project may be considered in reference to: modelling and control; hardware; and programming. Modelling involved the generation of a state-space model of a DC-DC converter and subsequent linearisation. Control design was done through LQR to produce observer state feedback and integral action regimes. Hardware design included component selections, PCB design, and peripheral circuit analysis. Programming produced a microcontroller that could interface with a DC-DC converter and peripherals, and communicate over USB.
