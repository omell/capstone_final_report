\subsubsection{Generating estimates of state variables}\label{sec:observing}
The observability matrix of our system has full rank, implying that there are no unobservable states. This fact by itself is limited in its insight however; another element affecting the accuracy of an observer regime is the condition number of the observability matrix.
\newpar
With the component values specified in Table~\ref{tab:cuk_values}:
\begin{align}
\texttt{cond(obsv(A, c)) = 5.5831e+13}
\end{align}
which is much larger than 1, indicating an ill-conditioned observability matrix. This suggests sub-optimal performance of our observer regime.
\newpar
In practise, it was found that precise estimates of states $v_{C2}$ and $i_{L2}$ could be extracted with an observer regime. States $v_{C1}$ and $i_{L1}$ were not able to be estimated to reasonable precision. Simulation data in support of this behaviour is provided in Figures~\ref{fig:estimating} and~\ref{fig:estimating2}.

The response to poor performance of the observer regime was to disable observer state feedback (achieved by setting the LQR weights for system states ($v_{C1}$, $v_{C2}$, $i_{L1}$, and $i_{L2}$) to 0; weight affecting $x_i$ is the only non-zero entry in weight matrix).
