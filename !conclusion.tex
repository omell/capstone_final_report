\section{Conclusion}
This report documented the steps taken in design in the areas of control, hardware, and programming, relevant to the construction of an ultra-capacitor charge management system.
\newpar
A model of the DC-DC converter at the basis of such a system was generated based on circuit analysis and mathematical relations, and was updated as required according to results of experiments and simulations.
\newpar
The model returned by this process was used to generate a control regime based on state feedback and integral action. A Luenberger observer was implemented to generate estimates of state variables. LQR was used to populate the control gain matricies.
\newpar
Circuitry to power peripheral components was designed and characterised, along with circuitry to charge the ultra-capacitors. A digital signal processing microcontroller was the computational element at the core of our hardware deliverable, which interfaced with sensing circuitry, power circuitry, and USB through UART.
\newpar
The process of programming this microcontroller was documented, along with techniques for implementing our observer regime.
\newpar
The entire system was simulated according to parameters corresponding to components used in constructing the hardware prototypes.
\newpar
Intricacies encountered when connecting the subsystems were documented. Performance of the control regime in hardware is yet to be documented.
