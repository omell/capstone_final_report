\subsection{Estimating voltages and currents for full-state feedback: the Luenberger observer}
For our system, there are states that are not able to be measured through any sensor regime (e.g. the voltages across ideal capacitors decoupled from parasitic resistances $v_{C1}$, $v_{C2}$). A Luenberger observer may be used to produce estimates of the system states, which may then be employed in a full-state feedback closed-loop control regime.
\newpar
A system is said to be observable (i.e. has no unobservable states) if the observability matrix as defined in Equation~(\ref{eqn:observable}) has full rank. This may easily be checked using the \textsf{MATLAB} call of~(\ref{matlab:observable}).
\begin{align}
\mathcal{O}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{c} \\
\boldsymbol{c}\boldsymbol{A} \\
\boldsymbol{c}\boldsymbol{A}^2 \\
\vdots \\
\boldsymbol{c}\boldsymbol{A}^{n - 1}
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\text{for a system with } n \text{ states}
\label{eqn:observable}
\end{align}
%
\begin{align}
\texttt{rank(obsv(A, c)) == 4}
\label{matlab:observable}
\end{align}
~\\
~\rule{\textwidth}{0.5pt}
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\dot{\hat{x}}}_\ell (t) &= \boldsymbol{A}\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_\ell(t) + \boldsymbol{b}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}(t) + \boldsymbol{b}_d \hat{d}(t) + \boldsymbol{L}\squarey{\hat{y}(t) - \hat{y}_\ell(t)}
\label{eqn:observer}
\\[11pt]
\boldsymbol{\dot{\hat{x}}}_\ell (t) &= \squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_\ell(t) + \boldsymbol{b}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}(t) + \boldsymbol{b}_d \hat{d}(t) + \boldsymbol{L}\hat{y}(t)
\label{eqn:observer2}
\end{align}
For an observable system, estimates of the perturbed plant states may be obtained by extracting the state vector in the system described according to Equation~(\ref{eqn:observer}) and the equivalent Equation~(\ref{eqn:observer2}), where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\boldsymbol{x}_\ell(t)$: vector containing state estimates
\item $y(t)$: measured converter circuit output voltage
\item $\hat{y}(t) = y(t) - Y$ where $Y$ is the steady-state output voltage as predicted by converter circuit model according to Equation~(\ref{eqn:modelY})
\item $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}(t) = \boldsymbol{u}(t) - \boldsymbol{U} = \begin{bmatrix}v_g - V_g & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$ is measured in the converter circuit
\item $\boldsymbol{L}$: observer gain
\end{itemize}
If $\squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}$ is stable, then the error between the estimated and actual system states decays to 0 exponentially.
\newpar
The observer gain matrix is typically populated such that the eigenvalues of $\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}$ are at least $10 \times$ faster than the eigenvalues of the closed-loop feedback system. The eigenvalues of this system may be placed by specifying the pole locations and calling \textsf{MATLAB}'s \texttt{acker} function as per~(\ref{matlab:place}).
\begin{align}
\texttt{L = acker(A', c', [p p p p])'}
\label{matlab:place}
\end{align}
where \texttt{p} is the desired pole location. Note that $(\quad\texttt{'}\quad)$ denotes transposition.

\subsection{Linear quadratic regulator (LQR); a method for determining $\boldsymbol{K}_f$ and $K_i$}\label{sec:LQR}
\textsf{MATLAB}'s \texttt{lqr} function was used to compute the gains $\boldsymbol{K}_f$ and $K_i$. This function is called with arguments \texttt{(A, B, Q, R, N)}, which are used to generated the state feedback law $\boldsymbol{u} = -\boldsymbol{K}\boldsymbol{x}$ that minimises the quadratic cost function
\begin{align}
J = \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}t\curly{\boldsymbol{x}^\intercal \boldsymbol{Q} \boldsymbol{x}
+ \boldsymbol{u}^\intercal \boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{u}
+ 2 \boldsymbol{x}^\intercal \boldsymbol{N} \boldsymbol{u}}
\label{eqn:LQR}
\end{align}
subject to system dynamics
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\dot{x}} = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{B}\boldsymbol{u}
\end{align*}
and the conditions
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(\boldsymbol{A}, \, \boldsymbol{B})$ is stabilizable\footnote{definition: all uncontrollable states are bounded; our system has no uncontrollable states and so is stabilizable} from \texttt{u}
    \item $0 < \boldsymbol{R}$
\end{itemize}
For our purposes the \texttt{lqr} function is called as
\begin{align*}
\texttt{lqr(A\_a, bD\_a, w*q, r)}
\end{align*}
where, for our system
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\texttt{A\_a}$: $\boldsymbol{A}_a$ of Equation~\ref{eqn:augmentedA}
	\item $\texttt{bD\_a}$: $\boldsymbol{b}_{d_a}$ of Equation~\ref{eqn:augmentedbD}
	\item $w \in \Re$: scalar multiplicative factor of $q$
	\item $q\in \Re^{5 \times 5}$: $\boldsymbol{Q}$ of Equation~\ref{eqn:LQR}; diagonal positive definite weight matrix that penalises variation of states from desired value
	\item $r \in \Re$: $\boldsymbol{R}$ of Equation~\ref{eqn:LQR}; weight that penalises control effort
	\item $N = 0$
\end{itemize}
$\boldsymbol{K}$ is extracted as
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{K}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{K}_f & K_i
\end{bmatrix}
=
\boldsymbol{R}^{\minus 1} \paren{\boldsymbol{B}^\intercal \boldsymbol{S} + \boldsymbol{N}^\intercal}
\end{align*}
where $\boldsymbol{S}$ is the solution to the algebraic Riccati equation
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{A}^\intercal \boldsymbol{S} + \boldsymbol{S}\boldsymbol{A} - \paren{\boldsymbol{S}\boldsymbol{B} + \boldsymbol{N}}\boldsymbol{R}^{\minus 1} \paren{\boldsymbol{B}^\intercal \boldsymbol{S} + \boldsymbol{N}^\intercal} + \boldsymbol{Q} = 0

\subsection{Discretisation: achieving emulation of a continuous-time system on a discrete-time microprocessor}\label{sec:disc}
The control theory thus far has operated in the continuous-time domain. For implementation of our control algorithm on the microcontroller, the observer system and integral action must be discretised. The appropriate discretisation method for our system is `zero-order hold' (ZOH). In this method the control inputs ($\hat{d}(t)$, $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}(t)$, $y(t)$, and $\hat{y}(t)$) are assumed to be constant over the sampling period $T_s$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Discretising the observer - ZOH}
Our observer system has the following description
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\dot{\hat{x}}}_\ell (t) = \squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_\ell(t) + \boldsymbol{b}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}(t) + \boldsymbol{b}_d \hat{d}(t) + \boldsymbol{L}\hat{y}(t)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_\ell(t)$: state vector produced by observer (estimated values)
\item $\hat{y}(t) = y(t) - Y$: output perturbation (measured output subtract steady-state output)
\end{itemize}
% \newpar
Assuming ZOH with a sampling time $T_s = \sfrac{1}{f_\text{sample}}$, the observer is described  by
\begin{align*}
\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_\ell [k + 1] &= \overline{\squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}}\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_\ell[k] + \overline{\boldsymbol{b}}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}[k] + \overline{\boldsymbol{b}_d} \hat{d}[k] + \overline{\boldsymbol{L}}\hat{y}[k]
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
\overline{\squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}} &= \exp \squarey{\paren{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}T_s}
\\[11pt]
\overline{\boldsymbol{b}} &= \paren{\int_0^{T_s} \mathrm{d}\tau \curly{\exp \squarey{\paren{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}\tau}}}\boldsymbol{b}
\\[11pt]
&= \paren{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}^{-1}
\paren{\overline{\squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}} - \boldsymbol{I}_4}
\boldsymbol{b}
\\[11pt]
\overline{\boldsymbol{b}_d} &=
\paren{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}^{-1}
\paren{\overline{\squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}} - \boldsymbol{I}_4}
\boldsymbol{b}_d
\\[11pt]
\overline{\boldsymbol{L}} &=
\paren{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}^{-1}
\paren{\overline{\squarey{\boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{c}}} - \boldsymbol{I}_4}
\boldsymbol{L}
\end{align*}
and where $\boldsymbol{I}_4$ is the identity matrix of dimension 4.

\subsubsection{Discretising integral action - forward-euler integration}
Discrete time integral action under the forward-euler method is achieved through the transfer function of Equation~\ref{eqn:integral_discrete}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:integral_discrete}
H(z) = \frac{T_s}{z - 1}

\subsubsection{Control summary}
At integer time step $k$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $r\squarey{k}$: input reference signal/desired output voltage
\item $y\squarey{k}$: output voltage as measured by ADC
\item $\hat{d}\squarey{k}$: duty ratio perturbation to be sent to update PWM signal
\item $\hat{y}\squarey{k}$: output voltage perturbation from steady-state calculated according to
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{y}\squarey{k} = y\squarey{k} - \, Y$
    \end{itemize}
\item $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}\squarey{k}$: input vector perturbation from steady-state calculated according to
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}\squarey{k} = \boldsymbol{u}\squarey{k} - \, \boldsymbol{U}$
    \item note that only the first element of $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}\squarey{k}$ changes while running the control loop; diode forward voltage drop is considered to be unchanging under forward bias
    \end{itemize}
\item $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_\ell\squarey{k}$: estimated state vector perturbation from steady-state
    \begin{itemize}
    \item used for full-state feedback control
    \end{itemize}
\item $\boldsymbol{x}_\ell\squarey{k}$: estimated state vector
    \begin{itemize}
    \item vector containing estimates of state variables
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Next, the disturbance filtering system $\boldsymbol{\delta}(t)$}
In continuous time
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\dot{\delta}}(t) = \boldsymbol{A}_\gamma^\intercal \boldsymbol{\delta}(t) + \boldsymbol{c}_\gamma^\intercal \hat{y}(t)
\end{align*}
In discrete time
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\delta}[k + 1] = \overline{\boldsymbol{A}_\gamma^\intercal}\boldsymbol{\delta}[k] + \overline{\boldsymbol{c}_\gamma^\intercal} \hat{y}[k]
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
\overline{\boldsymbol{A}_\gamma^\intercal} &= \exp{\squarey{\boldsymbol{A}_\gamma^\intercal T_s}}
\\[11pt]
\overline{\boldsymbol{c}_\gamma^\intercal} &= \boldsymbol{c}_\gamma^\intercal
