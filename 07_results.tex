\subsection{Testing}
Testing revealed that the gate driver IC did not function as anticipated. It was decided to bypass this IC and drive the \'{C}uk converter MOSFET directly from the microcontroller. This was the configuration used in testing performance of converter circuit powered from microcontroller PWM module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Open-loop - characterising transient response}
Testing on \'{C}uk converter begun was observing the transient response at three operation points with $100 \ \mathsf{\Omega}$ resistor as load. The results are provided in Table~\ref{tab:trans}. Simulated output extracted from \textsf{MATLAB} script of Appendix~\ref{apx:MATLAB}. \hl{Note that this test was performed without the gate driver IC connected correctly (and so current to switch converter circuit MOSFET came from microcontroller which was unable to supply that which was required). Upon correct connection of the gate driver IC the difference between output voltages in simulation and hardware was less than $1 \ \mathsf{\%}$.}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|}
\hline
Duty cycle  & Output voltage & Ripple  & Simulated output \\ \hline \hline
12.5\%      & -925mV         & 52mV     & -975mV \\ \hline
50\%        & -4.5V          & 68mV     & -5.02V\\\hline
62.5 \%     & -12.8V         & 63mV     & -8.38V\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Transient response}
\label{tab:trans}
\end{table}
Worst case settling time was found to be $\approx 10 \ \mathsf{ms}$ and was produced for $y \text{: } \minus 0.925 \rightarrow \minus 12.8 \ \mathsf{V}$. \hl{TODO explain right arrow notation}

\subsubsection{Open-loop - mapping duty ratio to output voltage}

Purpose of test: to compare hardware result Figure~\ref{fig:steps} with theoretical Figure~\ref{fig:out_parasitic}.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Testing operating region limits}
A PWM signal of duty ratio $85 \ \mathsf{\%}$ was sent to the converter to test stability, safety, and power usage. A summary of the data produced in this experiment is provided in Table~\ref{tab:heating}.
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Quantity & Value & Notes\\
    \hline
    $d$ & $85 \ \mathsf{\%}$ &\\
    \hline
    $v_o$ & $\minus 21 \ \mathsf{V}$ &\\
    \hline
    $v_g$ & $5 \ \mathsf{V}$ &\\
    \hline
    Output voltage ripple & $75 \ \mathsf{mV} \ (0.4 \ \mathsf{\%})$ &\\
    \hline
    Input current draw & $1.15 \ \mathsf{A}$&\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{}
    \label{tab:heating}
\end{table}
Output voltage ripple here refers to the peak-to-peak MOSFET switching noise at this operating point. Converter voltage ripple $\approx (1/3) \times \text{ switching noise}$. At this operating point the $100 \ \mathsf{\Omega}$ resistor dissipated $\sim 4 \ \mathsf{W}$ of heat (and became far too hot to touch).

\subsection{Controller}
% Collection of data to present performance of control regime in hardware is ongoing. Results are not in a state to present in this report at this time.
The performance of controller was tested on hardware. The reference points were hard-coded \{-1V, -11V, -6V, -1V, -8V, -11V \} with 200ms interval.The result is provided in Figure \ref{fig:performance}.

The controller was able to track the reference voltage well with \hl{little} overshoot and \hl{small} settling time. The summary of performance is provided in Table \ref{tab:performance}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Quantity        & Value  & Notes \\ \hline \hline 
    Settling time   & 26.4ms &  Reference -1V to -8V\\ \hline
    Overshoot       & 2.4V   &  Reference -1V to -8V\\ \hline
    Output voltage ripple & 23.7mV (XXX \%) & Reference 2V\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of controller performance}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{table}

The controller performned well, however when the reference changes from -1V to -11V, the saturation can be seen. This could be due to anti-windup. It was later discovered that reducing the gain of anti-windup resulted in less saturation and better performance.
