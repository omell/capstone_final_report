Note that this system is controllable from $\hat{d}$, which may be checked using the \textsf{MATLAB} call of~(\ref{matlab:controllable}) for our 4 state system. There are thus no uncontrollable states and thus $(\boldsymbol{A}, \, \boldsymbol{B})$ is stabilizable from $\hat{d}$ (a condition required to employ LQR control design).

\subsection{Testing}
Testing revealed that the gate driver IC did not function as anticipated. It was decided to bypass this IC and drive the \'{C}uk converter MOSFET directly from the microcontroller. This was the configuration used in testing performance of converter circuit powered from microcontroller PWM module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Open-loop - characterising transient response}
Testing on \'{C}uk converter begun was observing the transient response at three operation points with $100 \ \mathsf{\Omega}$ resistor as load. The results are provided in Table~\ref{tab:trans}. Simulated output extracted from \textsf{MATLAB} script of Appendix~\ref{apx:MATLAB}.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|}
\hline
Duty cycle  & Output voltage & Ripple  & Simulated output \\ \hline \hline
12.5\%      & -925mV         & 52mV     & -975mV \\ \hline
50\%        & -4.5V          & 68mV     & -5.02V\\\hline
62.5 \%     & -12.8V         & 63mV     & -8.38V\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Transient response}
\label{tab:trans}
\end{table}
Worst case settling time was found to be $\approx 10 \ \mathsf{ms}$ and was produced for $y \text{: } \minus 0.925 \rightarrow \minus 12.8 \ \mathsf{V}$.

\begin{figure}[H]

Purpose of test: to compare hardware result Figure~\ref{fig:steps} with theoretical Figure~\ref{fig:out_parasitic}.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Testing operating region limits}
A PWM signal of duty ratio $85 \ \mathsf{\%}$ was sent to the converter to test stability, safety, and power usage. A summary of the data produced in this experiment is provided in Table~\ref{tab:heating}.
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Quantity & Value [S.I.] & Notes\\
    \hline
    $d$ & $85 \ \mathsf{\%}$ &\\
    \hline
    $v_g$ & $5 \ \mathsf{V}$ &\\
    \hline
    Output voltage ripple & $75 \ \mathsf{mV} \ (0.4 \ \mathsf{\%})$ &\\
    \hline
    Input current draw & $1.15 \ \mathsf{A}$&\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{}
    \label{tab:heating}
\end{table}
Under these conditions the $100 \ \mathsf{\Omega}$ resistor dissipated $4 \ \mathsf{W}$ of heat (and became too hot to touch).
