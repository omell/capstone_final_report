Using LTSpice the chosen MOSFET for the \'Cuk Converter hardware implementation was modelled to determine the theoretical maximum current draw for the \SI{100}{kHz} switching frequency. The circuit shown in figure \ref{fig:sim_mosfet_circuit}.

Through experimentation the current limiting resistance $R_1$ was varied and found that \SI{10}{\ohm} gave a good compromise between switching speed and current. Despite this the gate current can reach $\pm\SI{180}{mA}$ which well exceeds the input/output source/sink of the microcontroller. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:sim_mosfet_plot}.
